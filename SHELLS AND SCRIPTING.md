### WHAT IS AN OS

An OS is the software that manages the computers hardware, software resources, and provides common services for the computer programs.

The structure  of an OS can be as follows:

![Windows OS](https://cis2.oc.ctc.edu/oc_apps/Westlund/xbook/111_u04e/NT_arch.jpg)

* Kernel - This is software at the core of a computers OS with complete control over everything in the system
* Shell - A command line interpreter which exposes access to an operating systems services. Generally either a command line or a GUI
* Terminal - The command line console built into the computer (usually), that allows us to utilise shell functionality without a GUI.
* Computer architecture - 





## GIT BASH

cd <directory name/path> - to change directory

touch <filename.extension> - creates a file in the current directory

cat >> <filename> - used to write to files

<filereader> <filename> - opens the file with specified reader

Ctrl + D - saves 



## STRONGLY-TYPED LANGUAGE

A strongly typed programming language must have its variable type declared when it is initialised. This variable cannot accept data of a different data type.

- It is statically typed - the type of each variable is known at compile time (not run time)
- It enforces type safety - prevents an incompatible value being assigned to a variable of specified type
- it is memory safe - prevents access to invalid memory



## SOME QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

WHAT IS .NET?

.NET is a software framework developed by microsoft language. The framework supports multiple languages which all run on a common language infrastructure (CLI)

What is a CLI?

A common language infrastructure is the platform on which .NET programs are executed. The CLI is made up of two components:

- The common intermediate language (CIL)
- The common language runtime (CLR)

WHAT IS THE CIL?

The CIL is an intermediate binary code that all .NET languages are complied to before they are run

WHAT IS THE CLR?

The CLR is a virtual machine that all .NET programs use instead of accessing the hardware. It manages the execution of .NET programs.

WHAT IS A Framework class library (FCL)?

This is a common library shared by the languages in the .NET framework. It supports programs written in the .NET framework.

What is the 'Static' keyword?

It makes an item non-instantiable. It can be applied to classes, variable, methods.





## PASSING BY REFERENCE & PASSING BY VALUE

Pass by reference - The method contains a reference to the object/value being manipulated. Any manipulation done by the method will directly affect the object in memory.

Pass by value - A copy of the object/value being manipulated is acted upon, thus the value in the global scope is not affected.
