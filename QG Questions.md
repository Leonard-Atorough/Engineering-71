What is API and explain the framework

Application programming interface. A software intermediary that allows applications to talk to each other. More specifically, it allows a level of application abstraction. We don't need to know how an application is giving us what we've requested, nor does it need to know how were going to use it. The api doesn't need to know either of the two but can take our request and return with a response.

Selenium 

- Selenium is a tool for automating browsers. That's it. What we use it for is to automate browers so we can test web pages on them.

Specflow 

- It helps teams bind automation to feature files and shares the resulting files as living documentation. Specflow uses the easy to understand gherkin syntax to define scenarios which can be bound to automated test steps.

Unit Test, Why is it important 

- Unit testing is important because it validates our code at a very early stage. This helps to reduce defects, the cost of testing and allow for improved code design.

TDD what is it? advantages? uses? 

- -TDD is test driven development. We write the smallest possible test case and then develop the minimum functionality to make the test pass. Afterwards we can refactor. red-green-refactor

- Unit tests do increase the amount of code that needs to be written. UT's can't effectively test UI. Can be problematic for software design as UT's solidify code, making modification more difficult. Unit tests can be difficult to write.

BDD same as TDD 

- Behaviour driven developed is an agile software development framework that focuses on collaboration between developers, testers, BA's and other non-technical team members. The goal is to derive requirements, test cases and features based on an understanding of how the product is expected to be used.

Test Automation Pyramid 

- The test automation pyramid is a diagram that shows the levels of granularity that different test types should have. It starts with unit tests at the bottom, suggesting they should represent 70% of AT, followed by Integration testing at 20% and then end to end testing at 10%. Above this is manual testing which features but isn't part of the TAP.

Disadvantages of Test Automation 

- Automation testing tools can be expensive
- Skilled automation tests can be expensive
- Time to develop software/frameworks
- Difficult to do UI/UX testing
- Some elements of manual/physical testing are not easy to replicate.
